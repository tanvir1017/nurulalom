          My experience in digital marketing and being able to run large
          marketing departments was largely shaped by the companies were I
          worked for many years. My journey through the intricate landscape of
          multinational corporations has provided me with a unique perspective
          on driving growth, building brand awareness, and fostering customer
          loyalty in todayâ€™s fiercely competitive global market.
